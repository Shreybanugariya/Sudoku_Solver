# Sudoku_Solver
A python program that solves Sudoku itself. 
A Backtracking algorithm that changes the values of the number entered at the empty blocks and changes the previous numbers by backtracking them and thus solving the whole sudoku. 

Thank you [Tech With Tim](https://github.com/techwithtim) for the GUI and the tutorial on how to use backtracking.
